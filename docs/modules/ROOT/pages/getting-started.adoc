Get your things on the Internet in 30 Seconds Flat with the AVR-IoT board!
____

Claims of "30 Seconds Flat" aside, it took closer to _two hours_ for
me to get the demo appilication described in the {user-guide}[User
Guide] to work.

In case anybody else is having the same issues, here are some
troubleshooting notes.

== Connecting to the Wi-Fi Network

The recommended procedure is as follows.

1. Connect the AVR-IoT WG to your computer with a mini-USB cable

2. Open the CURIOSITY drive and select `CLICK-ME.HTM` — this
redirects you to the AVR-IoT web demo application, which has a URL
like `\https://avr-iot.com/device/0123215BE1D6C474FE`

3. Use the provided form to create and save `WIFI.CFG` to your
computer with your network information

4. Drag `WIFI.CFG` to the CURIOSITY drive

When everything is working, the red LED on the AVR-IoT WG should turn
off and be replaced by a pleasant blue LED and a flashing yellow LED
(indicating that the light and temperature sensor data is being
published).

=== Problem 1: Dragging `WIFI.CFG` doesn't work

In my experience, simply dragging `WIFI.CFG` over to the CURIOSITY
drive didn't work. I {1}[have read] that repeating the drag-and-drop
process can eventually work, but there is another way to update the
Wi-Fi configuration using the serial command line interface that I
feel is more robust.

For this you will need to use a serial terminal application (like
{miniterm}[pySerial's Miniterm]) to send the `wifi` command.

[source, bash]
----
wifi SSID,PASSWORD,2 <1>
----
<1> Replace `SSID` and `PASSWORD` with the name and password of your
Wi-Fi network. The last number is the security option for your
network: one of the three options (1–3) outlined in the documentation.

Here is how it looks using `miniterm.py`. (The `-e` flag echoes the
input.)

[source, bash]
----
$ miniterm.py -e /dev/ttyACM0
--- Miniterm on /dev/ttyACM0  9600,8,N,1 ---

.Serial Port Permissions
****

If you get a permissions error connecting to the AVR-IoT serial
interface, you will need to update the permissions of the /dev/ttyACM0
device. Here is how to do this in Linux (Fedora).

[source, bash]
----
could not open port '/dev/ttyACM0': [Errno 13] could not open port /dev/ttyACM0: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyACM0'
----

A quick fix is to update the permissions until you next login.

[source, bash]
----
$ sudo chmod 0666 /dev/ttyACM0
----

A permanent solution is to add a rule for the TTY serial-USB device in
/etc/udev/rules.d/.

[source, bash]
----
$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ttyacm.rules
# Rule for /dev/ttyACM0

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2175", ATTRS{serial}=="ATML3203051800007956", MODE="0666"
----

In the above, the `idVendor` and `idProduct` values are found using
`lsusb`.

[source, bash]
----
$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 04f3:0903 Elan Microelectronics Corp.
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 8087:0a2b Intel Corp.
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 04f2:b56b Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 03eb:2175 Atmel Corp. <1>
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
----
<1> `03eb:2175` is the `idVentor:idProduct`, respectively.

The serial number `serial` can be found using `udevadm`.

[source, bash]
----
$ udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyACM0 | grep '{serial}' | head -n 1
    ATTRS{serial}=="ATML3203051800007956" <1>
----
<1> The serial number is unique to your AVR-IoT WG device.

After adding the new rule, it should be detected automatically next
time you plug in the AVR-IoT WG device.

=== Problem 2: `CLICK-ME.HTM` doesn't redirect with the device UID

When I open `CLICK-ME.HTM`, I am redirected to

[source, URL]
----
https://avr-iot.com/device/--------------------------------------------
----

Instead of dashes, the URL is suppose to contain the unique device ID
for the board. The correct ID can be found using the `device` command
in the serial command line interface.

[source, bash]
----
$ miniterm.py -e /dev/ttyACM0
--- Miniterm on /dev/ttyACM0  9600,8,N,1 ---
--- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
device
0123215BE1D6C474FE <1>
----
<1> Device ID

With this device ID, navigating to

[source, URL]
----
https://avr-iot.com/device/0123215BE1D6C474FE
----

will successfully open the demo application.
